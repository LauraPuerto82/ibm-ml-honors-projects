# 📊 Honors Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Ames Housing Dataset

This project was completed as part of the **honors track** in the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate (Course 1: Data Analysis with Python).

## 🧪 Objective
To perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing using the Ames Housing dataset.

## 📌 Key Tasks
- Distribution analysis of key features
- Handling missing values
- Outlier detection
- Log-transformations
- Hypothesis formulation and testing using t-tests and correlation

## 🧠 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `honors_notebook.ipynb` – Full analysis with visualizations
- `honors_project.pdf` – Summary report of the findings

## 🔍 Insights
- Strong positive relationship between `GrLivArea` and `SalePrice`
- Overall Quality is one of the most influential predictors
- Neighborhood has a significant impact on housing prices

## 🚀 Next Steps (Suggested in Report)
- Build regression models
- Include more predictors
- Explore non-linear models and interactions
